## 👋🏻 Introduction

I created this website to showcase my projects and offer insight into who I am. It demonstrates my skills in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and RESTful methods for frontend design, form handling, and APIs. Built with Python 3.11.9, Django 5.1.2, and dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🏅 Higlight best projects on main page.
* 💨 activate animated gifs, when you hover mouse on project images.
* 🔗 Links to social media
* 📎 Link to open resume in new tab
* 🎶 My Spotify top artists and tracks
* 🔗 Project links/ live links for each project.
* 📝 Contact form.

## 🛠 Project Status

This project is currently deployed on AWS through an EC2 instance.  This website will be updated when I create/start new projects.  I also plan on building out my spotify profile! 

## 📜 Credits

This website was created as part of my Capstone project, following the completion of a <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43579891?s=200&v=4" width="20">[CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.com/) bootcamp where I learned `Python` and `Djagno`.

To help build my `Spotify` profile, I used the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/#) package and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/).
