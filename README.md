## Introduction

I built this website to showcase all the projects that Iâ€™ve been working on and give a little insight as to who I am.
I aimed to display a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Python, Django, and RESTful methods to develop frontend design, sending forms, and the API framework.
This website was built with Python 3.11.9, Django 5.1.2, and other packages found in the `requirements.txt` file.
